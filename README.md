# Developers-Cognitive-Biases-during-Code-Review
This repository aims at investigating the (non)existence of supporting evidence for reviewersâ€™ availability and anchoring biases during code review. Some of the questions that this study tries
to answer are:

- Do developers confine their code review on a code change to issues other reviewers pointed
out in that change earlier (possibly due to availability bias)?
- Or do reviewers anchor their code review to specific issues (e.g., bugs they usually look for)?
